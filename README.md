# StudioGhibliMovies
This project will make use of https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com to display movies from Studio Ghibli and their details.
In this project I'm using cocoa pods as a dependency manager.

# Dependencies
- RXSwift for binding data with UI
- Using view code with help of Snapkit to improve constrains readability.
- SwiftLint for keeping code consistency based on the best practices for Swift.

This project was made using the concept of MVVM and dependency injections to pass data between controllers.
The Network layer is a simple enum based which together with protocols make it easy to expand and maintain.
